## About The Project

**Abstract**

Internal phosphorus loading (IPL) can be a significant phosphorus (P) source in freshwater systems, often causing water-quality improvement delays. Despite its importance, IPL estimates are missing for many freshwater systems due to several large-scale measuring and modeling challenges. In this study, we develop a modeling framework to estimate summer anoxic sediment release rates (SRRs) for P in 5899 large lakes and reservoirs (surface area > 1.0 km²; mixing depth < maximum depth) across the contiguous US (CONUS).  Our framework combines random forest models for bottom-water temperature (BT) and surface-water total P (TP) with a mixed-effects regression model for SRR, and it includes uncertainty propagation across these models. Our results indicate that mean summer SRR ranges from 1-37 mg/m²/day across CONUS lakes, with 31 % of waterbodies having SRR > 10 mg/m²/day. Areas of high SRR are generally associated with high predicted surface-water TP, which is particularly common in agricultural areas. Uncertainties in SRR predictions are largely attributable to the random forest-based inputs and predictive error in the SRR regression. In relatively dry summers, IPL is likely to be higher than external loading in 26 % of watersheds. Overall, our results reveal where IPL can be a critical factor in watershed nutrient management.

In this repository, we provide the data and models developed as a part of our study to predict IPL in large lakes and reservoirs across CONUS. Additionally, codes for nationwide IPL, BT and TP predictions along with uncertainty quantification are provided. The data needed to run the codes are stored in *Datafiles* folder and the codes are stored in *Codes* folder.

## Getting Started

The codes in this project are developed in R environment. To install and run R and RStudio on your computer, follow these steps:

### Installing R

1. **Download R:**
   - Visit the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).
   - Select your operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
   - Click on the appropriate link to download the R installer.

2. **Install R on Windows:**
   - Click on "Download R for Windows" and then on "base."
   - Download the latest version of R by clicking the link at the top of the new page.
   - Run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard steps.

3. **Install R on macOS:**
   - Click on "Download R for macOS."
   - Download the `.pkg` file for the latest version of R.
   - Run the `.pkg` file and follow the installation instructions.

### Installing RStudio

1. **Download RStudio:**
   - Go to the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
   - Click on "DOWNLOAD" under the RStudio Desktop section.

2. **Install RStudio:**
   - Download the installer for your operating system (Windows `.exe` or macOS `.dmg`).
   - Run the installer and follow the installation prompts.

### Running R and RStudio

1. **Open RStudio:**
   - After installation, open RStudio from your Start menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).

2. **Set Up RStudio:**
   - The RStudio interface consists of multiple panes: Source, Console, Environment, and Files/Plots/Packages/Help.
   - You can write R scripts in the Source pane and execute them in the Console.

3. **Install and Load Packages:**
   - Install packages using `install.packages("packageName")`.
   - Load packages using `library(packageName)`.

## Running Codes
Here's a step-by-step guide to how to the codes given here in RStudio:

### Forking a GitHub Repository

1. **Log in to GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Find the Repository:**
   - Navigate to the repository you want to fork. You can use the search bar at the top of the GitHub page.

3. **Fork the Repository:**
   - In the upper right-hand corner of the repository page, click the `Fork` button. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

4. **Clone the Forked Repository:**
   - Go to your GitHub profile and find the forked repository.
   - Click on the `Code` button and copy the URL (HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI) of the repository.

### Cloning the Repository in RStudio

1. **Open RStudio:**
   - Launch RStudio on your computer.

2. **Create a New Project:**
   - Go to the `File` menu, select `New Project`, then choose `Version Control`, and then `Git`.

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - In the `Repository URL` field, paste the URL you copied from GitHub.
   - Choose a directory where you want to store the project locally.
   - Click `Create Project`. RStudio will clone the repository and open it as a new project.

### Running the Code in RStudio

1. **Explore the Project:**
   - In the `Files` pane of RStudio, you can see all the files in the cloned repository.

2. **Open Scripts:**
   - Double-click on any R script (`.R` file) to open it in the `Source` pane.

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   - If the project depends on specific R packages, install them using `install.packages("packageName")`.
   - You can find a list of required packages within the script itself (usually at the top in the form of `my_packages <- c(packageName,...)`).

4. **Run the Code:**
   - You can run the entire script by clicking the `Source` button or by selecting `Code` > `Run Region` > `Run All`.
   - Alternatively, you can run line by line by selecting the line and pressing `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac).
